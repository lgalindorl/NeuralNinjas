Don't go knock my door
Don't go knock my door

Time is up, no more cheat and lie
No more tears to dry
You and I, we're like so "bye-bye"
Finally, I am over you
Totally unblue

When I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I
I'm telling you now

Don't go knocking on my door
Gotta stay away, for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back
Don't go knocking on my door

I can see, it's no mystery
It's so clear to me, what we had is all history
It's okay, I can sleep at night
It will be alright

I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I
I'm telling you now

Don't go knocking on my door (Baby)
Gotta stay away, for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back
Don't go knocking on my door (Door)
Gotta stay away, for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back (Ooh, yeah, yeah)

Don't go knock my door
Don't go knock my door
Don't go knock my door
Do what you want
As long as you don't come back
Don't go knocking on my door
Gotta stay away, for sure
And now I ain't buying that
You better get off my back

Don't go knocking on my door (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gotta stay away, for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back
Don't go knocking on my door (Ooh, yeah)
Don't go knocking on my door
Gotta stay away, for sure (Gotta stay away, for sure)
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back
Don't go knocking on my door

[Britney:]
"OK, OK, OK, OK, so listen, listen so then he goes, 'No matter what I do for you it never seems to be enough.' Aw! I can't believe he said that. You don't think I'm like that, do you?"
[Friend:]
"Well, you are..."
[Britney:]
"What?! Don't tell me you agree with him. Oh my God, oh my God!"
[Friend:]
"Well, I mean, one minute everything's fine and the next minute you're freaking out, it's like you never satisfied!"
[Britney:]
"Well, I know I'm a little picky... but, hey, I just know what I want."
