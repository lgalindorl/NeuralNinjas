This is a story about Mona Lisa
The Mona Lisa

Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell
About Mona Lisa, and how she suddenly fell
Now, see, everyone knew her, they knew her, oh, so well
Now I'm taking over to release her from her spell

She's the original (Yeah, yeah)
She's unforgettable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
She's been cloned
It's kind of incredible (Yeah, yeah)
She's so unpredictable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
She's been cloned, she's been cloned, she's been cloned

She was taken under, drowning in her sea
Running like an angel, she was crying and could not see (Oh, no)
Now, see, everyone's watching as she starts to fall
They want her to break down
There will be a legend of her fall

She's the original (Yeah, yeah)
She's unforgettable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
She's been cloned
It's kind of incredible (Yeah, yeah)
She's so unpredictable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
She's been cloned, she's been cloned, she's been cloned

Now, ladies, does that make you cry?
Mona Lisa's got to fly
Nobody really dies
Everyone, may we have a moment of silence?
Right here
God

She's the original (Yeah, yeah)
She's unforgettable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
She's been cloned
It's kind of incredible (Yeah, yeah)
She's so unpredictable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
That she's home, that she's home
She's the original (Yeah, yeah)
